v4.1 (2025-03-17)

  * replace exit() with _exit() in signal handler (suggested by elfring@github.com) 
  * error checking on lseek in ReadLockFile (suggested by elfring@github.com) 
  * switch to 'libUseful-bundled' directory name to prevent confusion between bundled and installed libUseful

  * add -nopriv/-nosu/-P flag to prevent priviledge elevation on linux
  * better debug/warning messages/logs

v3.0 (2023-07-26)
----------------
  * add -R, -q -L -syslog options

v2.0 (2022-03-26)

v1.0 (2019-02-12)
  * moved configure.in to configure.ac, as the latter is apparently the correct naming convention

  * added -C (Close on Exec) option
  * added -user and -group options
